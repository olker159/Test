        "description": "One of the most beautiful castles in the whole of Slovakia, Orava Castle was built all the way back in the 13th century, although earlier wooden palisades and fortifications once occupied its prominent outcrop. \\n\\nAs each generation added its own touches and additions, the castle boasts a variety of architectural styles, with Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance features all evident. \\n\\nIts museum houses some wonderful old artifacts and archaeological findings that document its rich history. Throughout the many centuries that it has stood atop the bluff, the Orava Castle has never been conquered; it’s easy to see why once you pass through its many gates, walls, and defenses.",

            "During the Second World War, Orava Castle served as an artillery observation post for German soldiers."
